# Macro Recorder

This is a basic macro recorder implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It allows users to record and replay a sequence of keyboard actions but does not support mouse movements, mouse button holds, or specific non-letter keys like Ctrl, Shift, etc.

## Features

-    Records and replays key presses and releases.
-    Provides a simple graphical user interface.
-    Displays recorded actions in a listbox.
-    Allows users to start and stop recording.
-    Supports replaying recorded actions.

## Usage

-    Run the script to launch the application.
-    Click the "Start Recording" button to begin recording your actions.

-    Click the "Stop Recording" button to stop recording.

Please note that this macro recorder captures and replays printable characters when recording keyboard inputs. It is designed for basic macro recording needs and may require further customization for specific use cases.
